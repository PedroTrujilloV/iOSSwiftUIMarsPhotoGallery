## HI!
This is an iOS Mars Photo Gallery that uses the **NASA JSON API** for loading photo information and use the url in this json info to create the data models, then feed the view models with these models for downloading and cache the photos asynchronously. After this, these are presented in the view. The view is written in **Swift & SwiftUI** using **FRP** with **Combine framework**. As design patter I picked **MVVM** . The UI was made to mimic the Pinterest layout.
